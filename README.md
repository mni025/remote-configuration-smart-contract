# Remote IC Configuration via Smart Contracts 

This work explores how an IC can be programmed repeatedly and securely using blockchain-based smart contracts. This programmability will enable users to upgrade or rentIC features for a predetermined duration. 

We implemented the remote IC configuraiton in both pure software and hardware-software co-design.

# Demo
